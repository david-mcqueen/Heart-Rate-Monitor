# Heart-Rate-Monitor
Creating a HRM that will provide audio annoucnements of the users BPM at a given interval (e.g. every 2 mins)

This will work in conjunction with applications such as Strava, which dont currently provide an audio announcement of the heart rate.
The user will be able to select how often they want to recieve audio announcements, and then the application will provide the current heart rate at those times.

Plans to expand this into heart rate zones:
The user will define their zones, and then when moving from one zone to another, an audio announcement will be made.
