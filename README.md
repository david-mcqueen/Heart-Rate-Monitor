# Pulser
This is the main repo for Pulser (http://www.pulser.co.uk/), an iOS application which provides audible announcements as to the users current heart rate.

This will work in conjunction with applications such as Strava, which dont currently provide an audio announcement of the heart rate.
The user will be able to select how often they want to recieve audio announcements, and then the application will provide the current heart rate at those times. Pulser also saves the heart rate information to Health Kit.
